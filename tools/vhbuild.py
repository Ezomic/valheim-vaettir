    Unwraps every part at real-world scale, one part at a time, before the join.

    Without this the OBJ ships Blender's generated primitive UVs, where every face of
    every box gets the same patch of the 0..1 square - so a 3cm strap and a 1.2m
    plank claim the same amount of texture, and the runtime's atlas fit turns that
    into texture density varying forty-fold across one model. The runtime (Skins.Fit)
    expects UVs in METRES - 1 UV unit per metre - and picks the density itself.

    Per part, before the join, and that is load-bearing: a cube projection maps
    position straight to UV, so projecting the joined model would give every part a
    UV span equal to the whole model's bounding box - two 15cm lumps 0.74m apart
    would claim 0.74m of texture. (Kynda measured exactly that: 6 texels/m against a
    target of 35.)

    Two transform details, both easy to get wrong:
    - Scale is applied first. A box's mesh data is a unit cube with its real size in
      the object's scale; projecting before applying hands a 13cm post and a 90cm
      plank identical UVs. This also bakes an orb's stretch.
    - Location is NOT applied, or every part's UVs carry its world position and the
      span becomes the model's bounding box again. Rotation is held back until after
      the projection - cylinders are built along local Z and the cylinder projection
      needs the axis there; a cube projection on an already-rotated box skews every
      face - then applied, so nothing downstream changes.
